Report_submit is the report as it was submitted to the Examination Schools. This version contains some typos. These were corrected in the normal Report 
report2_submit.bib is the .bib file as it was submitted to the Examination Schools. That also contains some errors, which are corrected in the normal report2.bib file (used in Report.tex etc). For compilation I used some script that set the title to et al in the case of multiple authors, which I put into the unsrt bibliography style, so that might not compile the same on other computers.  

The figures are those used in the .tex files.
